A \abstdefterm{path coloring} of a graph $G$ is a vertex coloring
of $G$ such that each color class induces a disjoint union of paths.
We present two efficient algorithms
to construct a path coloring of a plane graph.

The first algorithm, based on a proof of Poh, %\cite{Poh1990}
is given a plane graph;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
using three colors.

The second algorithm,
based on similar proofs
by Hartman % \cite{Har1997}
and \v{S}krekovski, %\cite{Skr1999}
performs a list-coloring generalization of the above.
The algorithm is given a plane graph and an assignment of lists of
three colors to each vertex;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
in which each vertex receives a color from its list.

Implementations of both algorithms are available.

\section{Introduction}

All graphs will be finite, simple, and undirected.
See West~\cite{Wes2000} for graph theoretic terms.

A \defterm{path coloring} of a graph $G$ is a vertex coloring
(not necessarily proper) of $G$ such that each color class induces
a disjoint union of paths.
A graph $G$ is \defterm{path $k$-colorable} if $G$
admits a path coloring using $k$ colors.

Broere \& Mynhardt conjectured~\cite[Conj.~16]{BrMy1985}
that every planar graph is path $3$-colorable.
This was proven independently by Poh~\cite[Thm.~2]{Poh1990}
and by Goddard~\cite[Thm.~1]{God1991}.

\begin{theorem}[Poh 1990, Goddard 1991]\label{T:planar3c}
If $G$ is a planar graph,
then $G$ is path $3$-colorable.\ggcnopf\end{theorem}

It is easily shown that the ``$3$'' in Theorem~\ref{T:planar3c}
is best possible.
In particular, Chartrand \& Kronk~\cite[Section~3]{ChKr1969}
gave an example of a planar graph whose vertex set cannot be partitioned
into two subsets, each inducing a forest.

Hartman~\cite[Thm.~4.1]{Har1997}
proved a list-coloring generalization of Theorem~\ref{T:planar3c}
(see also Chappell \& Hartman~\cite[Thm.~2.1]{ChHa2017prep}).
A graph $G$ is \defterm{path $k$-choosable} if,
whenever each vertex of $G$ is assigned a list of $k$ colors,
there exists a path coloring of $G$ in which each vertex receives
a color from its list.

\begin{theorem}[Hartman 1997]\label{T:planar3}
If $G$ is a planar graph,
then $G$ is path $3$-choosable.\ggcnopf\end{theorem}

Essentially the same technique was used by
\v{S}krekovski~\cite[Thm.~2.2b]{Skr1999}
to prove a result slightly weaker than Theorem~\ref{T:planar3}.


\medskip

We discuss two efficient path-coloring algorithms
based on proofs of the above theorems.
We distinguish between a \defterm{planar} graph---one that
can be drawn in the plane without crossing edges---and
a \defterm{plane} graph---a graph with a given embedding
in the plane.

In Section~2 we outline our graph representations
and the basis for our computations of time complexity.

Section~3 covers an algorithm
based on Poh's proof of Theorem~\ref{T:planar3c}.
The algorithm is given a plane graph;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
using three colors.

Section~4 covers an algorithm
based Hartman's proof of Theorem~\ref{T:planar3},
along with the proof of \v{S}krekovski mentioned above.
The algorithm is given a plane graph
and an assignment of a list of three colors to each vertex;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
in which each vertex receives a color from its list.

Implementations of both algorithms are available;
see Bross~\cite{Bro2017}.


\section{Graph Representations and Time Complexity}

We will represent a graph via \textit{adjacency lists}:
a list, for each vertex $v$, of the neighbors of $v$.
A vertex can be represented by an integer $0\dots n-1$,
where $n$ is the order of the graph.

A plane graph will be specified via
a \defterm{rotation scheme}:
a circular ordering,
for each vertex $v$, of the edges incident with $v$,
in the order they appear around $v$ in the plane embedding;
this completely specifies
the combinatorial embedding of the graph.
Rotation schemes are convenient when we represent a graph
using adjacency lists;
we simply order the adjacency
list for each vertex $v$ in clockwise order around $v$;
no additional data structures are required.

The input for each algorithm
will be a triangulated plane graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, represented
via adjacency lists. The input size will be $n$, the number of vertices. Note
that $\mathcal{O}(m)=\mathcal{O}(n)$, so it is equivalent to take the input size
to be $m$, the number of edges. Moreover, arbitrary simple planar graphs may be
plane embedded and triangulated in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, see Boyer and
Myrvold~\cite{BoMy2004}.

In Section~4, given an edge $uv$, we will need an efficient operation to
find $v$'s entry in $u$'s adjacency list from $u$'s entry in $v$'s list.
An \defterm{augmented adjacency list} is an adjacency list such that for
every edge $uv$ a reference to $v$'s entry in
$u$'s list is stored in $u$'s entry in $v$'s list, and vice versa. Given an
adjacency list representation of a graph, an augmented
adjacency list representation may be constructed in $\mathcal{O}(m)$ time via
the following procedure.

\begin{algorithm}\label{A:augment}
\textbf{Input:} An adjacency list representation Adj of a graph $G$.

\noindent\textbf{Output:} An augmented adjacency list representation Adj' of $G$
with the same rotation scheme as Adj.

\noindent\textbf{Step 1:} Construct an augmented adjacency list copy Adj' of Adj
with the reference portion of each entry uninitialized.

\noindent\textbf{Step 2:} For each vertex $v$ construct an array $\text{Wrk}[v]$
storing vertex-reference pairs. For each $v$ from $0$ to $n-1$ iterate through
$\text{Adj}'[v]$. For each neighbor $u$ in $\text{Adj}'[v]$ append the pair $(v,r_v(u))$ to
$\text{Wrk}[u]$ where $r_v(u)$ is a reference to $u$'s entry in $\text{Adj}'[v]$.

\noindent\textbf{Step 3:} For each $v$ from $n-1$ to $0$ iterate through
$\text{Wrk}[v]$. Upon reaching each pair $(u,r_u(v))$ in $\text{Wrk}[v]$ the last element of
$\text{Wrk}[u]$ will be $(v,r_v(u))$; for details on why this is, see the paragraphs
below. Use
$r_u(v)$ and $r_v(u)$ to look up and assign references for the edge $uv$ in
Adj'$[u]$ and Adj'$[v]$. Remove $(v,r_v(u))$ from the back of $\text{Wrk}[u]$.
\end{algorithm}

After completing Step $2$ in Algorithm~\ref{A:augment} the array $\text{Wrk}[v]$ contains
a pair $(u,r_u(v))$ for each neighbor of $v$, sorted in increasing order of by
the neighbor $u$.

Let $v$ be the current vertex at a given iteration of Step $3$ in
Algorithm~\ref{A:augment}. For each edge $uw\in E(G)$ such that
$u<w$ and $v<w$, prior iterations of Step 3 will have initialized the
references for $uw$ in $\text{Adj}'[u]$ and $\text{Adj}'[w]$, and also removed the pair
$(w,r_w(u))$ from $\text{Wrk}[u]$. Therefore for each $(u,r_u(v))$ in
$\text{Wrk}[v]$, the array $\text{Wrk}[u]$ will contain only entries for
vertices $w$ where $w\le v$. Since $\text{Wrk}[u]$ is sorted in
increasing order by the neighboring vertices, the last element of
$\text{Wrk}[u]$ must be $(v,r_v(u))$.

\section{Path Coloring: the Poh Algorithm}

We will first describe Poh's algorithm for path $3$-coloring plane graphs.

\begin{algorithm}[Poh 1990]\label{A:planar3}
\textbf{Input:} A weakly triangulated plane graph $G$ with outer face a
cycle $C=v_1,v_2,\ldots, v_k$ and a $2$-coloring of $C$ such
that each color class induces a path, $P_1=v_1,v_2,\ldots, v_l$ and
$P_2=v_{l+1},v_{l+2},\ldots, v_k$ respectively.

\noindent\textbf{Output:} An extension of the $2$-coloring of $C$ to a path
$3$-coloring of $G$ such that no vertex in $G-C$ receives the same color as a
neighbor of that vertex in $C$.

\noindent\textbf{Step 1:} If $G=C$ then $G$ is already path $3$-colored and we
are done. Otherwise there are two cases to consider.

\noindent\textbf{Case 1.1:} Suppose $C$ is an induced subgraph of $G$. Let
$u,w\in V(G)-V(C)$ such that the cycles $u,v_1,v_k$ and $w,v_l,v_{l+1}$ each
exist and are faces of $G$; note that
$u$ and $w$ are unique, but may not be distinct. Since $C$ is induced and
$G\ne C$, $G-C$ is connected.
Let $P_3=u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_r$ be an induced $u,w$-path in $G-C$.
Color each vertex of $P_3$ with the third color not used in the $2$-coloring of
$C$. Let $C_1=v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_l,u_r,u_{r-1},\ldots,u_1$ and
$C_2=u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_r,v_{l+1},v_{l+2},\ldots,v_k$.

\noindent\textbf{Case 1.2:} Suppose $C$ is not an induced subgraph. Then there
exists an edge $v_iv_j\in E(G)-E(C)$ such that $i\le l < j$. Let
$C_1=v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_i,v_j,v_{j+1},\ldots,v_k$
and $C_2=v_i,v_{i+1},\ldots,v_j$.

\noindent\textbf{Step 2:} Apply Algorithm~\ref{A:planar3} separately to the
maximal subgraph of $G$ with outer face $C_1$ and to the maximal subgraph with outer face
$C_2$.
\end{algorithm}

Note that the graph $G$ is finite and the recursive
step applies the algorithm to two proper subgraphs of $G$. Therefore
Algorithm~\ref{A:planar3} must terminate.

Let $G$ be a triangulated plane graph. We may trivially path $2$-color the outer
triangle. Applying Poh's algorithm extends this coloring to a path $3$-coloring
of $G$.

\end{figure}

In Poh's original proof he picked the induced $u,w$-path in Case 1.1 to be the
shortest $u,w$-path.
Thus a natural way to implement Poh's algorithm is to first locate $u$ and $w$,
and then use a breadth-first search to
to either construct a $u,w$-path or locate
a chord edge if no such path is possible.

\begin{algorithm}\label{A:poh_bfs}
\textbf{Input:} A cycle $C=v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k$ in a triangulated plane
graph $G$ represented by adjacency lists, and a $2$-coloring of $C$ such
that each color class induces a path, respectively $P_1=v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_l$ and
$P_2=v_l,v_{l+1},\ldots,v_k$.

\noindent\textbf{Output:} An extension of the $2$-coloring of $C$ to a path
$3$-coloring of the maximal subgraph of $G$ with outer face $C$.

\noindent\textbf{Step 1:} Iterate Adj[$v_1$] to locate the vertex $u$
immediately following $v_k$. Note that since $G$ is triangulated, $v_1,u,v_k$ is
a face of $G$.

\noindent\textbf{Case 1.1:} If $u\in C$, then $u=v_{k-1}$, since $G$ is
triangulated, and $C$ is not an induced cycle. We then
apply Algorithm~\ref{A:poh_bfs} to the cycle $C'=v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{k-1}$.

\noindent\textbf{Case 1.2:} Perform a breadth-first of the maximal subgraph of
$G$ with outer face $C$, starting from the
vertex $u$. Terminate the search upon locating a vertex $w\not\in C$ with adjacent
neighbors $v_i\in P_1$ and $v_j\in P_2$ such that $i\ne 1$ or $j\ne k$.
Backtrack along the breadth-first search
to construct a minimal $u,w$-path $P_3=u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_r$. Let
$C_1=v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_i,u_r,u_{r-1},\ldots,u_1$ and
$C_2=u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_r,v_j,v_{j-1},\ldots,v_k$. Apply Algorithm~\ref{A:poh_bfs}
separately to $C_1$ and $C_2$. If $i=l$ and $j={l+1}$ then $C$ was an induced
cycle and we are done. Otherwise, also apply Algorithm~\ref{A:poh_bfs} to
$C_3=v_i,v_{i+1},\ldots,v_j$.
\end{algorithm}

Unfortunately Algorithm~\ref{A:poh_bfs}
is not linear. To see this, consider the family of
graphs $\{G_k\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ depicted in
Figure~\ref{F:poh_bad_graph_collection}. Fix $k\in\mathbb{N}$ and note that
$n=n(G_k)=k(k+1)/2+3$. Assume
that the outer triangle is path $2$-colored such that the top vertex is
assigned a color distinct from the bottom two. At iteration $i$ of Poh's
algorithm the shortest path through the interior will be the path of length
$l=k-i+1$ directly along the base of the inner triangle. A breadth-first search
of this inner triangle will hit all $l(l+1)/2$ vertices in order to find this
path. Therefore the total number of operations performed will be
\[
    \Theta\left( \sum_{l=1}^k\frac{l(l+1)}{2} \right)=\Theta(n^{3/2}).
\]
So Poh's algorithm with breadth-first search is $\Omega(n^{3/2})$.

However, the correctness of Poh's algorithm only relied on
locating some induced $u,w$-path.
We will show below that there exists a linear time implementation of Poh's
algorithm so long as we do not always find the shortest $u,w$-path.

The general strategy will be to first mark all vertices
interior to $C$ that have a neighbor in $P_1$. We will then construct an
induced path $P_3=u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_d$ consisting only of marked vertices
such that $C_1=P_1\cup P_3\cup\{u_1v_1,u_dv_l\}$ is a cycle of minimal length.

The algorithm then relies on the following observation: if $P_3=u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_d$
is such a $u,w$-path described above, then $P_3$ is an induced path. To see
this, we observe that
if $u_iu_j$ is an edge between vertices in $u_i,u_j\in P_3$, then $u_iu_j$ must be an
interior chord of $C_1$ because $C_1$ is of minimal length. However, since
every vertex in $P_3$ has a neighbor in $P_1$, the planarity of $G$ determines
that the only edges $u_iu_j$ are those where $j=i+1$.

\begin{algorithm}\label{A:poh_linear}
\textbf{Input:} An induced cycle $C=v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k$ in a triangulated plane
graph $G$ represented by adjacency lists, and a $2$-coloring of $C$ such
that each color class induces a path, respectively $P_1=v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_l$ and
$P_2=v_l,v_{l+1},\ldots,v_k$. Additionally, a marking of vertices indicating which
vertices in $G-C$ have neighbors in $P_1$; denote the set of such vertices
$N(P_1)$.

\noindent\textbf{Output:} An extension of the $2$-coloring of $C$ to a path
$3$-coloring of the maximal subgraph of $G$ with outer face $C$.

\noindent\textbf{Step 1:} If $N(P_1)=\emptyset$, then $G-C$ is empty and thus $G$ is
already path $3$-colored.
    
Suppose that $N(P_1)\ne\emptyset$. Let $u,w$ be the vertices in $N(P_1)$ such that $v_1, v_k, u$
and $v_l,v_{l+1}, w$ are
cycles in $G$. We will construct
an induced path $P_3=u_1,\ldots,u_r$ such that $u_1=u$, $u_r=w$, and $u_1,\ldots,u_r\in
N(P_1)$. Concurrently, we will
mark all vertices interior to the cycle $C_2=P_3\cup P_2\cup\{v_ku,v_{l+1}w\}$
with neighbors in $P_3$ and record all
edges between vertices in $P_3$ and vertices in $P_1$ or $P_2$.

Initialize $u_1=u$. We will also define $u_0$ to be $v_k$ so that
$u_{i-1}$ is defined when $i=1$.

Let $u_1,\ldots,u_i$ be the the induced path constructed so far. Iterate
through $\text{Adj}[u_i]$ clockwise starting from $u_{i-1}$ until we reach a
vertex $u_{i+1}\in N(P_1)$ distinct from $u_{i-1}$ or we reach a vertex in $P_1$. If
we reach a vertex in $P_1$ first then $u_i$ must be $w$ or there wouldn't be a
$u,w$-path in $G$ consisting of vertices in $N(P_1)$, a contradiction. If we reach a
vertex $u_{i+1}\in N(P_1)$ we add it to the path and continue.
    
While iterating
through $\text{Adj}[u_i]$ let us also mark all neighbors between $u_{i-1}$ and
$u_{i+1}$ to indicate which vertices interior to $C_2$ have neighbors in $P_3$.
We also record all edges between $u_i$ and vertices in $P_1$ and $P_2$.

\noindent\textbf{Step 2:} Color the vertices on the path $P_3$ with the
remaining color not used on vertices in $P_1$ or $P_2$. Define the cycles
$C_1=P_1\cup P_3\cup\{v_1u,v_lw\}$ and $C_2=P_3\cup
P_2\cup\{v_ku,v_{l+1}w\}$. In step 1 we recorded all chords of $C_1$ and
$C_2$, and also marked all vertices interior to $C_2$ that are in $N(P_3)$.
Moreover, the vertex marking from the input distinguishes those
interior to $C_1$ that are in $N(P_1)$; in fact all vertices interior to $C_1$ will be in
$N(P_1)$. 
Therefore we may decompose $C_1,C_2$ into induced cycles and apply
Algorithm~\ref{A:poh_linear} to each.
\end{algorithm}

Suppose that $G$ is a triangulated plane graph. We may path $2$-color the outer
triangle, mark all vertices with neighbors in one of the colored paths, and
then apply Algorithm~\ref{A:poh_linear} to extend this to a path
$3$-coloring of $G$.

Note that while executing Algorithm~\ref{A:poh_linear} we only iterate through
the adjacency list of a vertex when it is colored and added
to a path. Therefore the algorithm is linear in the number of vertices.

\section{Path List Coloring: the Hartman-\v{S}krekovski Algorithm}

In this section we will discuss a linear time algorithm for path coloring
plane graphs such that each vertex receives a color from a specified list.
Hartman showed that this is always possible when each vertex is given a
list of $3$ colors, see Theorem~\ref{T:planar3}.
