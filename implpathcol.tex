\begin{abstract}
A \abstdefterm{path coloring} of a graph $G$ is a vertex coloring
of $G$ such that each color class induces a disjoint union of paths.
We present two efficient algorithms
to construct a path coloring of a plane graph.

The first algorithm, based on a proof of Poh, %\cite{Poh1990}
is given a plane graph;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
using three colors.

The second algorithm,
based on similar proofs
by Hartman % \cite{Har1997}
and \v{S}krekovski, %\cite{Skr1999}
performs a list-coloring generalization of the above.
The algorithm is given a plane graph and an assignment of lists of
three colors to each vertex;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
in which each vertex receives a color from its list.

Implementations of both algorithms are available.

\section{Introduction}

All graphs will be finite, simple, and undirected.
See West~\cite{Wes2000} for graph theoretic terms.

A \defterm{path coloring} of a graph $G$ is a vertex coloring
(not necessarily proper) of $G$ such that each color class induces
a disjoint union of paths.
A graph $G$ is \defterm{path $k$-colorable} if $G$
admits a path coloring using $k$ colors.

Broere \& Mynhardt conjectured~\cite[Conj.~16]{BrMy1985}
that every planar graph is path $3$-colorable.
This was proven independently by Poh~\cite[Thm.~2]{Poh1990}
and by Goddard~\cite[Thm.~1]{God1991}.

\begin{theorem}[Poh 1990, Goddard 1991] \label{T:planar3c}
If $G$ is a planar graph,
then $G$ is path $3$-colorable.\ggcnopf\end{theorem}

It is easily shown that the ``$3$'' in Theorem~\ref{T:planar3c}
is best possible.
In particular, Chartrand \& Kronk~\cite[Section~3]{ChKr1969}
gave an example of a planar graph whose vertex set cannot be partitioned
into two subsets, each inducing a forest.

Hartman~\cite[Thm.~4.1]{Har1997}
proved a list-coloring generalization of Theorem~\ref{T:planar3c}
(see also Chappell \& Hartman~\cite[Thm.~2.1]{ChHa2017prep}).
A graph $G$ is \defterm{path $k$-choosable} if,
whenever each vertex of $G$ is assigned a list of $k$ colors,
there exists a path coloring of $G$ in which each vertex receives
a color from its list.

\begin{theorem}[Hartman 1997] \label{T:planar3}
If $G$ is a planar graph,
then $G$ is path $3$-choosable.\ggcnopf\end{theorem}

Essentially the same technique was used by
\v{S}krekovski~\cite[Thm.~2.2b]{Skr1999}
to prove a result slightly weaker than Theorem~\ref{T:planar3}.


\medskip

We discuss two efficient path-coloring algorithms
based on proofs of the above theorems.
We distinguish between a \defterm{planar} graph---one that
can be drawn in the plane without crossing edges---and
a \defterm{plane} graph---a graph with a given embedding
in the plane.

In Section~2 we outline our graph representations
and the basis for our computations of time complexity.

Section~3 covers an algorithm
based on Poh's proof of Theorem~\ref{T:planar3c}.
The algorithm is given a plane graph;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
using three colors.

Section~4 covers an algorithm
based Hartman's proof of Theorem~\ref{T:planar3},
along with the proof of \v{S}krekovski mentioned above.
The algorithm is given a plane graph
and an assignment of a list of three colors to each vertex;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
in which each vertex receives a color from its list.

Implementations of both algorithms are available;
see Bross~\cite{Bro2017}.


\section{Graph Representations and Time Complexity}

We will represent a graph via \textit{adjacency lists}:
a list, for each vertex $v$, of the neighbors of $v$.
A vertex can be represented by an integer $0\dots n-1$,
where $n$ is the order of the graph.

A plane graph will be specified via
a \defterm{rotation scheme}:
a circular ordering,
for each vertex $v$, of the edges incident with $v$,
in the order they appear around $v$ in the plane embedding;
this completely specifies
the combinatorial embedding of the graph.
Rotation schemes are convenient when we represent a graph
using adjacency lists;
we simply order the adjacency
list for each vertex $v$ in clockwise order around $v$;
no additional data structures are required.

We will assume an integer RAM model of computation. The input for each algorithm
will be a connected planar graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, represented
via adjacency lists. The input size will be $n$, the number of vertices. Note
that $\mathcal{O}(m)=\mathcal{O}(n)$.

In Section~4, given an edge $uv$, we will need an efficient operation to
find $v$'s entry in $u$'s adjacency list from $u$'s entry in $v$'s list.
An \defterm{augmented adjacency list} is an adjacency list such that for
any edge $uv$, a reference to $v$'s entry in
$u$'s list is stored in $u$'s entry in $v$'s list, and vice versa. Given an
adjacency list representation of a graph, an augmented
adjacency list representation may be constructed in $\mathcal{O}(m)$ time via
the following algorithm.

\begin{algorithm} \label{A:augment}
\textbf{Input:} An adjacency list representation Adj of a graph $G$

\textbf{Step 1:} Construct an augmented adjacency list copy Adj' of Adj with
the reference portion of each entry uninitialized.

\textbf{Step 2:} For each vertex $v$ construct an array Wrk[$v$] storing
vertex-reference pairs. For each $v$ from $0$ to $n-1$ iterate through
Adj'[$v$]. For each neighbor $u$ in Adj'[$v$] let
$r_{v,u}$ be a reference to $u$'s entry in Adj'[$v$] and append the pair
$(v,r_{v,u})$ to Wrk[$u$].

\textbf{Step 3:} For each $v$ from $n-1$ to $0$ iterate through Wrk[$v$]. At
the pair $(u,r_{u,v})$ in Wrk[$v$] note that the last element of Wrk[$u$] is
$(v,r_{v,u})$. Look up and assign references for the edge $uv$ in Adj'. Remove
$(v,r_{v,u})$ from the back of Wrk[$u$].
\end{algorithm}

After completing Step 2 in Algorithm \ref{A:augment} the array Wrk[$v$] contains
a pair $(u,r_{u,v})$ for each neighbor of $v$, sorted in increasing order of by
the neighbor $u$. At a given vertex $v$ in Step 3 in Algorithm \ref{A:augment},
for each edge $uw\in E(G)$ such that
$u<w$ and $v<w$, we shall have the initialized references for $uw$ in Adj'[$u$]
and Adj'[$w$] and removed the pair $(w,r_{w,u})$ from Wrk[$u$]. The next
iteration of Step 3 will handle edges $uv$ with $v>u$.

\section{Path Coloring: the Poh Algorithm}

We will first describe Poh's algorithm for path $3$-coloring plane graphs.
If $C$ is a cycle in a plane graph $G$ we will use Int$(C)$ to denote
the subgraph of $G$ consisting of $C$ and all interior vertices and edges.

\begin{algorithm}[Poh 1990] \label{A:planar3}
\textbf{Input:} A weakly triangulated plane graph $G$ with outer face a
cycle $C=v_1,v_2,\ldots, v_k$. Additionally, suppose $C$ is $2$-colored such
that each color class induces a path, $P_1=v_1,v_2,\ldots, v_l$ and
$P_2=v_{l+1},v_{l+2},\ldots, v_k$ respectively.

\textbf{Step 1:} If $G=C$ then $G$ is already path $3$-colored and we
are done. Otherwise there are two cases to consider.

\textbf{Case 1.1:} Suppose $C$ is an induced cycle in $G$. Let
$u,w\in V(G)-V(C)$ such that $uv_1v_k$ and $wv_lv_{l+1}$ are faces; note that
$u$ and $w$ are unique, but may not be distinct. Since $C$ is induced and
$G\ne C$, $G-C$ is connected.
Let $P_3=u_1u_2\ldots u_r$ be a shortest $u,w$-path in $G-C$.
Color each vertex of $P_3$ with the third color not used in the $2$-coloring of
$C$. Let $C_1=v_1v_2\ldots v_lu_ru_{r-1}\ldots u_1$ and
$C_2=u_1u_2\ldots u_rv_{l+1}v_{l+2}\ldots v_k$.

\textbf{Case 1.2:} Suppose $C$ is not an induced cycle. Then there
exists an edge $v_iv_j\in E(G)-E(C)$ such that $i\le l < j$. Let
$C_1=v_1v_2\ldots v_iv_jv_{j+1}\ldots v_k$
and $C_2=v_iv_{i+1}\ldots v_j$.

\textbf{Step 2:} Apply Algorithm \ref{A:planar3} to
Int$(C_1)$ and Int$(C_2)$.
\end{algorithm}
