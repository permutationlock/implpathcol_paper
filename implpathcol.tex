\begin{abstract}
A \abstdefterm{path coloring} of a graph $G$ is a vertex coloring
of $G$ such that each color class induces a disjoint union of paths.
We present two efficient algorithms
to construct a path coloring of a plane graph.

The first algorithm, based on a proof of Poh~\cite{Poh1990},
is given a plane graph;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
using three colors.

The second algorithm,
based on similar proofs
by Hartman~\cite{Har1997}
and \v{S}krekovski~\cite{Skr1999},
performs a list-coloring generalization of the above.
The algorithm is given a plane graph and an assignment of lists of
three colors to each vertex;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
in which each vertex receives a color from its list.

Implementations of both algorithms are available.

\section{Introduction}

All graphs will be finite, simple, and undirected.

A \defterm{path coloring} of a graph $G$ is a vertex coloring
(not necessarily proper) of $G$ such that each color class induces
a disjoint union of paths.
A graph $G$ is \defterm{path $k$-colorable} if $G$
admits a path coloring using $k$ colors.

Broere \& Mynhardt conjectured~\cite[Conj.~16]{BrMy1985}
that every planar graph is path $3$-colorable.
This was proven independently by Poh~\cite[Thm.~2]{Poh1990}
and by Goddard~\cite[Thm.~1]{God1991}.

\begin{theorem}[Poh 1990, Goddard 1991] \label{T:planar3c}
Let $G$ be a planar graph.
Then $G$ is path $3$-colorable.\ggcnopf\end{theorem}

Hartman~\cite[Thm.~4.1]{Har1997}
(see also Chappell \& Hartman~\cite[Thm.~2.1]{ChHa2017prep})
proved a list-coloring generalization of Theorem~\ref{T:planar3c}.
A graph $G$ is \defterm{path $k$-choosable} if,
whenever each vertex of $G$ is assigned a list of $k$ colors,
there exists a path coloring of $G$ in which each vertex receives
a color from its list.

\begin{theorem}[Hartman 1997] \label{T:planar3}
Let $G$ be a planar graph.
Then $G$ is path $3$-choosable.\ggcnopf\end{theorem}

Essentially the same technique was used by
\v{S}krekovski~\cite[Thm.~2.2b]{Skr1999}
to prove a result slightly weaker than Theorem~\ref{T:planar3}.

We distinguish between a \defterm{planar} graph---one that
can be drawn in the plane without crossing edges---and
a \defterm{plane} graph---a graph with a given embedding
in the plane.
A plane graph will generally be specified via
a \defterm{rotation scheme}, which is a circular ordering,
for each vertex $v$, of the edges incident with $v$.
When the circular ordering of the edges around each vertex $v$
is the order in which they appear---clockwise, say---around $v$
in the plane,
then the rotation system completely specifies the combinatorial
embedding of the graph.
Rotation systems are particularly convenient when we represent a graph
using adjacency lists;
we simply order the adjacency
list for each vertex $v$ in clockwise order around $v$,
and no additional data structures are required.

\medskip

We discuss two efficient path-coloring algorithms
based on proofs of the above theorems.

Section~2 covers an algorithm
based on Poh's proof of Theorem~\ref{T:planar3c}.
The algorithm is given a plane graph;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
using three colors.

Section~3 covers an algorithm
based Hartman's proof of Theorem~\ref{T:planar3},
along with the proof of \v{S}krekovski mentioned above.
The algorithm is given a plane graph
and an assignment of a list of three colors to each vertex;
it produces a path coloring of the given graph
in which each vertex receives a color from its list.

Implementations of both algorithms are available;
see Bross~\cite{Bro2017}.
